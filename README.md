## Polish text datasets

### Task oriented datsets

* [The KLEJ (Kompleksowa Lista Ewaluacji Językowych) benchmark is a set of nine evaluation tasks for the Polish language understanding.](https://klejbenchmark.com/index.html)
* PolEval datasets - 
    * Hate speech classification -distinguish between normal/non-harmful tweets (class: 0) and tweets that contain any kind of harmful information (class: 1) [[PolEval 2019 Task6](http://2019.poleval.pl/index.php/tasks/task6)]  [[mirror GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dp7h9FrejUGK4jOeMsuxObiwP5h4x6q6?usp=sharing)]
* [Polish CDSCorpus](http://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/Scwad/CDSCorpus) - The dataset for compositional distributional semantics. Polish CDSCorpus consists of 10K Polish sentence pairs which are human-annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment. 
* [Wroclaw Corpus of Consumer Reviews Sentiment (WCCRS)](https://clarin-pl.eu/dspace/handle/11321/700) - corpus of Polish reviews annotated with sentiment at the level of the whole text (*text*) and at the level of sentences (*sentence*) for the following domains: hotels, medicine, products and university (reviews*)
